# ECL Code Snippets

ECL stands for "Enterprise Control Language" and it is the language you use when working with HPCC Systems' big data technology.  More information on the technology can be found at https://hpccsystems.com.  The platform's Open Source repo is at https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform.

The code snippets here were useful at some time or another, and someone may find them useful again.  Most are stand-alone functions, function macros, or macros, meant to be used within a larger ECL program.  The code in the BWR directory are executable scripts rather than libraries.  Most code is well-commented.
